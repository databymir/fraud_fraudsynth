    "Spoiler alert: This data science project did not have the outcome I was anticipating.\n",

    "When I set out to do this project, I had found a dataset on Kaggle called \"FraudSynth,\" which was described as \"a meticulously crafted synthetic dataset tailored for the development and evaluation of credit fraud detection models. With a focus on mirroring real-world credit application scenarios, this dataset encompasses a diverse range of applicant information, financial details, and intentionally introduced anomalies to simulate fraudulent activities\" (Ismail, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of that sounded great, so I downloaded the data and set out on a mission to train a fraud detection model. Specifically, I thought that I would likely train a few different types of models, including a Logistic Regression Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier. I also considered using an ensemble method like bagging or stacking to leverage the insights of multiple classifiers together.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as I got into my exploratory data analysis, an increasing number of red flags were popping up. It turned out that this \"meticulously crafted synthetic dataset\" appeared to be *too* meticulously crafted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project that follows this overview will walk through my data exploration, analysis, and model training to identify the signs that pointed to data quality issues and discuss the limitations of utilizing overly perfect synthesized data to build machine learning models."

The above statistics are currently indicating that 'amount' is the only variable demonstrating any type of diversion from the uniformity of the other features, which I will confirm later in the data visualization portion of the exploratory data analysis."

    "__Observation__:\n",
    "\n",
    "This boxplot demonstrates a distinctly different range of transaction amounts for each class ('fraud' vs. 'legitimate'). The fraudulent transactions were all for higher amounts than the legitimate transactions. This indicates that a machine learning model likely can predict fraudulent activity based on the amount of a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cautionary Note__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the other suspiciously evenly synthesized data, it is worth noting that this boxplot demonstrates an unusually prominent threshold over which transactions are fraudulent: \\\\$1,000. This is indicated by the top whisker of the legitimate boxplot extending up to \\\\$1,000 while the bottom whisker of the fraud boxplot extends down to \\\\$1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real-world, I would expect some overlap; stated differently, it is realistic to expect that some transactions above \\\\$1,000 are legitimate while some transactions below \\\\$1,000 are fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on all of the exploratory data analysis, it is clear that this dataset lacks the complexity and richness of real-world data. The oversynthesized nature of the data means that a model trained on this data will likely have very limited predictive value on real-world data that it hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, for educational purposes, I will proceed with preparing the data and training a logistic regression model to detect fraud. "

    "During my exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered several data quality issues with the FraudSynth dataset. These issues limit the reliability of the model and provide important lessons about working with synthetic data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perfectly Balanced Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset has an exact 50/50 split between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. While balanced datasets are often desirable, such a clean split is unrealistic in most real-world fraud detection scenarios, where fraud is relatively rare. This makes it easier for models to predict fraud but reduces their real-world applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Zero Correlation Between Features\n",
    "\n",
    "    When plotting a correlation matrix of the quantitative features, I found no correlation between any of the variables. This suggests that the dataset was synthesized too perfectly, and no meaningful relationships exist between other features. In real-world data, I would expect to see some correlation between features, such as age and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Categorical Features Show Uniform Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly, cross-tabulations of the qualitative features revealed a uniform distribution between fraud and legitimate cases, suggesting the features were not simulated to reflect real-world distributions. This overly simplified approach likely prevents the model from learning any complex patterns."

    "While performing exploratory data analysis, I found that transaction amount was the only feature that indicates predictive value in determining whether a transaction is fraudulent. However, relying on a single feature is problematic for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting to a Single Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "   By focusing only on transaction amount, the model fails to generalize well to new data. Real-world fraud detection involves multiple nuanced factors, such as user behavior patterns, location, and timing. If the model is only capturing the relationship between transaction amount and fraud, it might miss other important signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the real world, fraudulent transactions do not always follow a simple, predictable pattern like \"large transaction amounts indicate fraud\". A model that only learns from one feature may perform poorly if fraudsters change tactics or if new types of fraud emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Synthetic Dataset Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "   Because the dataset was overly synthesized, the other features— such as age, income, or location— provided no additional predictive value. In real-world scenarios, these features would likely have some influence on fraud detection."

As a result, I do not want to block small legitimate transactions and bother the customers to determine their legitimacy.

    "This isn't the outcome I expected when I first set out to create a fraud detection model, but it is an excellent cautionary tale about the risks of utilizing non-representative data and the importance of working with more realistic, noisy datasets. Ultimately, this was a good stepping stone towards deeper fraud analytics and anomaly detection work that considers real-world data complexities."
